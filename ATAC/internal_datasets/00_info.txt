# The directories were transferred from methylome2 with the fastq files within their own directories. 

# Initially, when downloading from Peng's methylome2 raw data, they were in the following directories based on each run. Some samples were rerun, so there is a suffix such as -1 or -2 added to some directories

# 00_directories.txt is a list of the directories that are present

# STEP 0: Run cellranger-arc 
# First, for each of the directories with fastq files, run the cellranger-atac pipeline. This will take quite a while (1-2 days to preprocess all samples since this is done serially)
nohup bash 00_send_cellranger_atac.sh &

# STEP 1-2: Examine the metadata for each donor, and merge together. Copy over the fragment files together

# STEP 3: Run cellsnplite on the Fetal samples to confirm their identities. The script below will send the script run_cellsnplite_pseudobulked.sh for each of the FASTQ directories.
$ bash 03_send_cellsnplite.sh -d .

# STEP 4: Verify the sex of all of the donors (mainly for the fetal samples where this was not known beforehand)
