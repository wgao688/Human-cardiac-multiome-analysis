# Human cardiac multiome analysis
This repository contains the scripts used for the analysis of the human cardiac snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomic datasets in the manuscript titled "Single-cell multiomic integration identifies widespread, cell-type resolved 
fetal reactivation in the diseased human heart"). For any questions regarding these scripts, please reach out to william.gao@pennmedicine.upenn.edu. 

This repository includes several subdirectories. For each subdirectory, there is a `00_info.txt` file describing the contents of the directory, and the order of the commands used to generate the paper figures. Some of the scripts are run in the command line; others are interactive Jupyter notebooks. To run these notebooks/scripts, there are some R/python libraries that need to be downloaded, which will be indicated in the scripts/notebooks.
