# Step 1: Run liana for disease vs. non-disease contrast on the scvi batch corrected adata. This will take about 5 hours. The input will be the final RNA adata with the scvi corrected counts (../../05E_all_snRNA_adata.h5ad). The contrast is specified by -c. This will save three outputs that will be used for the next step:
- disease_binary_cardiac_tensor_metadata.pkl : The metadata object 
- disease_binary_cardiac_tensor.pkl : The object with the actual tensor
- 01_adata_metadata.csv: The adata.obs metadata

$ nohup python3 01_run_liana_for_heart_dataset_part_1.py -i ../../07_final_RNA.h5ad -c disease_binary & 

# Step 2: Perform the tensor decomposition in Google Colab, so download the output files from 01_run_liana_for_heart_dataset_part_1.py and transfer over the Google Drive. 

# Step 3: Also on Colab, perform visualization and analysis of the tensor decomposed adata.
