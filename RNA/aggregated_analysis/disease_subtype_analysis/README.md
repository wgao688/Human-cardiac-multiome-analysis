## Disease subtype fetalization analysis

Examine the donor-pseudobulked fetalization score for each cell type across each of the disease categories.

### STEP 1: Perform pseudobulked analysis and visualization in python

This script performs the pseudobulked analysis for each of the disease subtypes.

### STEP 2: Produce plots in R (for figure consistency)

Use the color theme and produce violin plots in R.
