## Spatial transcriptomics analysis

This directory analyzes human heart spatial transcriptomics datasets generated using 10X Visium. There are two datasets from Kuppe 2022 (MI and ND hearts) and Kanemaru 2023 (ND hearts only). Only LV samples were analyzed in our study. 

There are three subdirectories with more information about the analyses performed.

- `Kuppe_2022`: Downloading and analysis of Kuppe 2022 datasets
- `Kanemaru_2023`: Downloading and analysis of Kanemaru 2023 datasets
- `joint_analysis`: Includes scripts for combined analysis of both datasets (e.g., Moran's I, proportion of fetalization spots)
