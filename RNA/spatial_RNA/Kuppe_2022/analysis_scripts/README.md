## Fetal reactivation spatial analysis for Kuppe 2022

### STEP 1: Examine fetal reactivation across Visium spots

Use the script `01_analyze_spatial_fetalization_using_cell_type_proportions.ipynb` to examine the cell-type proportion weighted fetal reactivation gene signatures. 

The plots and adata files with fetalization scores are produced from this analysis are stored in `adata_with_fetalization_scores/`.

The output `Kuppe_Moran_I_results.csv` includes the proportion of fetalization spots and the Moran's I computation.
