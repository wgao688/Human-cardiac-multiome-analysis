## RNA-seq analyses

This directory is the main directory for RNA-seq analyses. It includes several subdirectories:

- `internal_datasets`: raw data files and processing scripts for Penn datasets
- `external_datasets`: downloaded processed data for external data sources, each within its own subdirectory
- `aggregated_analysis`: combination of all LV single **NUCLEUS** RNA-seq datasets, including fetal, non-diseased postnatal, and diseased postnatal
- `scRNA_seq`: analysis of single **CELL** RNA-seq datasets, and comparison of these dataset to snRNA-seq datasets
- `GSEA_sets`: gene set enrichment analysis lists, including Jaccard filtered gene sets
