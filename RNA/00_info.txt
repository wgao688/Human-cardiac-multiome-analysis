# This directory is the main directory for RNA-seq analyses. It includes several subdirectories:

- internal_datasets/: raw data files and processing scripts for Penn datasets
- external_datasets/: downloaded processed data for external data sources, each within its own subdirectory
- aggregated_analysis/: combination of all LV single NUCLEUS RNA-seq datasets, including fetal, non-diseased postnatal, and diseased postnatal
- scRNA_seq: analysis of single CELL RNA-seq datasets, and comparison of these dataset to snRNA-seq datasets; also use of this to investigate deconvolution
- GSEA_sets: gene set enrichment analysis lists, including Jaccard filtered gene sets
- GTEx_bulk: analysis of the bulk RNA-seq LV datasets from the GTEx consortium
