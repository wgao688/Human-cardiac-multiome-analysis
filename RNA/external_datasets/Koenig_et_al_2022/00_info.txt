# Data source: download from GEO
# Single cell n=7 (2 donor, 5 DCM), single nuclei n=38 (25 donor, 13 DCM)

#### STEP 0: Download the R object with the processed data 

# GEO download link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE183852

# More info: The dataset from Koenig et al. 2022 is available in GEO as an adata object. To use this with scanpy, we need to extract the relevant information and use that to create an adata object. This script is in R, opening the object and extracting the needed info into a subdirectory called Seurat_to_h5ad/. From there, we will use another python script to use this information to create an adata object. 

#### STEP 1: Conver the Seurat obj to files that can be read into scanpy
# Use the 01_convert_Seurat_to_adata.R script for converting from R to format compatible with adata; this already has the paths needed hard-coded in the script so just run it

Rscript 01_convert_Seurat_to_adata.R

### STEP 2: Convert to adata
python3 02_load_into_adata.py

### STEP 3: Perform processing interactively to get the entire adata object with donor-level metadata

### STEP 4: Perform processing separately for diseased and non-diseased nuclei; also create the object for single cell data
