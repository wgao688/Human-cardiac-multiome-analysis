## Steps for preprocessing the Reichart 2022 dataset

Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, Reichart et al. 2022 characterized the transcriptome of 880,000 nuclei from 18 control and 61 failing, nonischemic human hearts with pathogenic variants in DCM and ACM genes or idiopathic disease.

The majority of the non-diseased donors from their study were NOT generated by their study, but rather from other studies. The metadata ages are only provided in terms of the decades (e.g. 70-79), rather than the exact age, so we will use the half-way age.

### STEP 0: Download the data

Download adata from CZI portal using wget:

The link to scanpy h5ad object is https://datasets.cellxgene.cziscience.com/3716fb19-cedd-4fe5-abc4-5dbeb007fb65.h5ad, so we download the h5ad via wget:
```
wget -O Reichart_et_al_2022.h5ad https://datasets.cellxgene.cziscience.com/3716fb19-cedd-4fe5-abc4-5dbeb007fb65.h5ad
```

### STEP 1: Preprocess the non-diseased dataset, which only includes 6 ND donors that are not already in other datasets
- `01A_preprocess_Reichart_LV_ND.ipynb`

### STEP 2: Preprocess the diseased dataset, which includes >60 donors. Therefore, there is a non-iteractive script and interactive script. The overall preprocessing takes about 1.5 hours, so the non-interactive script may be preferred.
```
- nohup python3 02_preprocess_Reichart_LV_diseased.py &
OR 
- 02_preprocess_Reichart_LV_diseased.py
```

### OUTPUTS:
- `processed_Reichart_ND.h5ad`: The processed Reichart non-diseased LV nuclei adata
- `processed_Reichart_diseased.h5ad`: The processed Reichart diseased LV nuclei adata
