# ENCODE v4 (Snyder Lab) has 54 snRNA-seq datasets which are also multiome, so they have a corresponding snATAC-seq library

# STEP 0: Download processed data 

# Run this to download all of the processed adata from ENCODE server
# nohup xargs -L 1 curl -O -J -L < ENCODE_files.txt & 

# Move these after transferring into the tarballs/ directory

# The cell types have NOT been annotated
# We will run scVI integration on these datasets and annotate the data ourselves
